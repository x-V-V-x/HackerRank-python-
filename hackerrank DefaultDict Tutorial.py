"""" DefaultDict Tutorial
Task
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It’s similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn’t use a defaultdict you’d have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn’t, set it to what you want. """

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
n, m = map(int, input().split())
for i in range(n):
    d[input()].append(str(i + 1))
for j in range(m):
    print(' '.join(d[input()]) or -1)
